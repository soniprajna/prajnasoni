I'm interested in exploring methodologies that help us understand and bridge the socio-technical gap in AI systems - their evaluations, deployments, and governance. 

Currently thinking about: 

- **Improving evaluations**
  *e.g. how can we better measure evaluations to ensure construct validity and claim validity?*

- **Context-specificity**
  _e.g. how do we effectively operationalise evaluations in multilingual and code-switching environments?_

- **Performance Robustness**
  _e.g. To what extent are model behaviors stable, and hence evaluation results robust, across semantic perturbations, distribution shifts, or rephrased inputs?_


If you're also thinking about the above, let's chat!
